        <h1>The Greedy Farmer</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Ram who owned a small farm. He worked hard every day but was often dissatisfied with the modest harvest his land produced. One morning, as Ram was tilling his fields, he struck something hard. Digging further, he discovered a shiny, golden hen.

        To his astonishment, the hen laid one golden egg every day. Ram was overjoyed. "I’ll sell these eggs and become rich!" he thought. He cared for the hen and sold its golden eggs in the market, earning enough to live a comfortable life.

But over time, greed crept into Ram's heart. "Why wait for one egg a day? What if the hen has more golden eggs inside? I could take them all at once and become wealthy instantly!"

Ignoring his better judgment, Ram decided to cut open the hen. To his dismay, there were no eggs inside, only the lifeless body of the magical hen. With the hen gone, Ram lost his daily source of wealth and returned to his old life of struggle and regret.
