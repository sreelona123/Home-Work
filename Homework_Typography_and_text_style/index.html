         Typography and text properties are essential aspects of web design, as they define
         how content appears and is read by users. In this assignment, we explored the 
         concepts of font-family, font-size, font-style, and other text-related CSS properties
         to enhance the presentation of a webpage. The thoughtful application of these properties
         helps create a clear visual hierarchy and improves readability, ensuring a better user experience.

     We experimented with properties like text-transform, text-decoration, and text-indent
     to add stylistic elements to our webpage. For instance, uppercase transformation in headings and indents
     in paragraphs helped in creating a professional and clean layout. Additionally, using text-overflow with 
     ellipses provided a practical solution for handling overflowing content. This approach ensures a balance 
     etween aesthetics and functionality.

        Lastly, pseudo-elements such as ::before and ::after were utilized to add decorative elements without
         cluttering the HTML structure. These, along with proper alignment and spacing, showcase how CSS can 
         bring structure and style together in web development. This assignment not only enhanced our understanding 
         of typography but also allowed us to apply creative solutions to common design challenges.
